\begin{longexample}[\quad \large Rotational Motion]
A block of mass $4m$ is attached to a light string and passes over a pulley with negligible rotational inertia and is wrapped around a vertical pole of radius $r$.  The block is then released from rest, causing the string to unwind and the vertical pole it is wrapped around to rotate.  On top of the vertical pole lies a horizontal rod of length $2L$ with block2s of mass $m$ attached to both ends.  The rotational inertia of this apparatus is $2mL^2$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the tension in the string in terms of the acceleration of the falling block?
\item What is the torque exerted on the rotating pole by the string in terms of the acceleration of the falling block?
\item When the large block has fallen a distance $D$, what is the instantaneous rotational kinetic energy of the apparatus?
\end{enumerate}
